# Doom-Inspired Maze Generator and Solver

Welcome to the Doom-Inspired Maze project! This maze application, developed in Java using JavaFX, incorporates Design Patterns and adheres to SOLID Principles. The primary goal is to generate and solve mazes, drawing inspiration from the iconic video game Doom.

## Features

- **Backend in Java, Frontend in JavaFX:**
  - The maze application is built with a Java backend and a JavaFX frontend, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience.

- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - Implemented various search algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Best First Search, providing diverse maze-solving approaches.

- **Design Patterns and SOLID Principles:**
  - Applied the Strategy Design Pattern for algorithm selection, enhancing the flexibility and extensibility of the codebase.

- **MVVM Architecture for GUI:**
  - Utilized JavaFX with the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for the graphical user interface, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

- **Memory-Efficient Maze Storage:**
  - Created a memory-efficient compressed maze storage solution, optimizing the utilization of resources.
